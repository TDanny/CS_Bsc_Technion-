Hey,
worked a lot on this one, implementation of Malloc , Calloc , Realloc and Free in 2 Different ways:
first file - "malloc_Basic" :  implementation of Malloc , Calloc , Realloc and Free.
second file - "malloc_hardcore" - manage different kind of memmory , allocation that is small engouth is allocated on the HEAP ,
larger allocation will be allocte on the DATA section of the memory .
moreover, there is multipile actions if a block is freed and can be splited to allocate the new request and create a new block from the leftovers 
of the other block. 
there is more functionality that you can read about in the Task Insturction PDF.

By the way - the main.cpp is just for examples and tests.
you can try to malloc,calloc,realloc and free  by yourself .
enjoy .
